Machine Learning Project

# Overview

This project demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a machine learning model using a regression approach. The key tasks include data exploration, preprocessing, applying machine learning techniques, and reporting performance metrics.

# Steps to Perform

## 1. Load the Data

- Import the dataset into your code environment.

- Verify the structure and quality of the data.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Perform a detailed analysis of the data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.

- Visualize key insights using plots and graphs.

- Summarize findings to guide further processing.

## 3. Data Preprocessing Pipelines

- Design data preprocessing pipelines to:

- Handle missing values.

- Normalize or scale numerical features.

- Encode categorical variables.

- Remove outliers if necessary.

## 4. Data Preprocessing

- Apply the designed preprocessing techniques to the data.

- Ensure data is in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## 5. Split Data

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

- Keep 20% of the data aside as test data.

## 6. Apply Machine Learning Techniques

- Implement multiple regression models, such as:

- Linear Regression

- Decision Tree Regressor

- Random Forest Regressor

- Gradient Boosting Regressor

- Train these models using the preprocessed training data.

## 7. Evaluate Model Performance

- Use the test dataset to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

# Report the following metrics for each model:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- R2-Score

# Tools and Libraries

The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

Python: Programming language.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
